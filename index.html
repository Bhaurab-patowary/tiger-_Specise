            <mark class="pera">There</mark> is actually only one tiger species, but each type of tiger is considered a subspecies.<br>
             A subspecies is a group within a species that is either physically or genetically different from the rest.
              There are nine subspecies or types of tigers, three of which are now extinct.<br>
               The remaining six subspecies include the Bengal, Indo-Chinese, South China, Amur, and Sumatran tigers.<br>

               Tigers are one of the most awe-inspiring, courageous wild animals living today.<br>
               The world’s largest cat species can be found in far east Russia, parts of North Korea,
                China, India, Southwest Asia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.<br>
                 However, the human population has grown and encroached on tiger habitats, 
                 causing their territory to decrease. Pressure from habitat loss, 
                 illegal killing and shrinking food supply have pushed all species of tigers on to the endangered list.<br>

                 Unfortunately, you won’t have the opportunity to see three extinct tiger species.
                 These include the <mark class="highlight">Caspian tiger </mark>(Panthera tigris virgata), the <mark  class="highlight">Bali tiger </mark>
                 (Pantera tigris balica) and the <mark  class="highlight">Javan tiger </mark>(Panthera tigris sondaica).
                  These subspecies of tigers have not been spotted in decades and none 
                  are known to be in captivity.

            The Caspian tiger was a large, powerful tiger that lived around the Caspian Sea. <br>
            Its colors were muted. So much so, in fact, the Caspian tiger was sometimes<br>
            referred to as the “gray tiger”. However, surviving pelts have rusty orange <br>
            fur with quite a bit of brown. Perhaps the gray was a mutation such as that<br>
            which created the white tiger or the blue tiger.<br>

            The Bali tiger, another native of the Indonesian islands, was once the world’s<br> 
            smallest tiger. The male weighed between 200 and 220 pounds and the female, <br>
            between143 and 176 pounds. It hasn’t been seen since the 1930s. The only remains<br>

             the Bali tiger and the Sumatran tiger. The Javan tiger was slightly larger than the Bali.<br>
             Although it has been listed as extinct since the 1970s, there are still periodic tiger <br>
             sightings in the area which could be Javan.<br>
